                   INVERSE  -  Version 3.0

         Program documentation for PC on INVERSE.DOC 

PURPOSE: To run a geodetic inverse to obtain the forward, backward 
         azimuths & the ellipsoidal distance when given the geodetic
         coordinates of the FROM & TO stations.

         Latitudes : North/South Hemisphere (+/- 0 to  89 59 59.9999)   
         Longitude : East/West Hemisphere   (+/- 0 to 179 59 59.9999)

         2004 APRIL  (SID SAFFORD)

INPUT: - Ellipsoid options :

         - GRS80 (NAD83) / WGS84
         - Clarke 1866 (NAD27) 
         - Any other ellipsoid

       - Geodetic coordinates :            First Station (FROM station)
       - Geodetic coordinates :            Second Station (TO station)


OUTPUT:
       - Forward Azimuth (from North) to : Second Station (TO station)
       - Back azimuth (from North) to :    First Station (FROM station)
       - Ellipsoidal distance (in meters)                             


EXECUTING INVERSE:

       Hardware requirements:

       - Can be run from hard disk or floppy disk.
       - The 8087 math co-processor.
       - 120K of main memory
       - A printer with 80 character/line if hard copy is desired.
         
         THE CODE WAS WRITTEN IN FORTRAN77 AND WAS COMPILED
         WITH THE IBM PROFESSIONAL FORTRAN COMPILER. TO RUN
         THE EXECUTABLE PROGRAM, YOU MUST HAVE AN IBM PC OR
         XT OR AT WITH THE MATH COPROCESSOR. IF YOU HAVE
         ANOTHER KIND OF PC, THE SOURCE CODE MUST BE RECOMPILED.

       To execute: 

       Type in - INVERSE

       Respond appropriately to prompts.

       A sample copy of a run is listed below:

 129 00 34.89797


   Enter  TO  STATION NAME  (Forepoint) :  
SAMPLE_TWO

   Enter  TO  STATION GP (Geodetic Position) :
hDD MM SS.sssss  Latitude :      (h default = N )
 35            

hDDD MM SS.sssss Longitude :     (h default = W )
 129                


First  Station :  SAMPLE_ONE       
---------------- 
  LAT =  35 00 16.99130 North
  LON = 129 00 34.89797 West 

Second Station :  SAMPLE_TWO
---------------- 
  LAT =  35 00 00.00000 North
  LON = 129 00 00.00000 West 

Forward azimuth        FAZ = 120 36 34.3299 From North
Back azimuth           BAZ = 300 36 54.3477 From North
Ellipsoidal distance     S =      1028.2340 m
